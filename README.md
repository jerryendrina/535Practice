# Covid-19 Forecasting Application

This application aims to package what I learned from my Python class 
including what I self taught myself from my readings and from watching 
instructional videos. This is an application that directly reads-in 
data from a [Covid-19 API](https://covid19api.com/ ), where current and up-to-date 
forecasting, a machine learning method, can be done once the API is updated and
the application is run. I also used an object-oriented-programming to present 
results in an organized manner by structuring the program into separate python files 
and generate a multipage application. The app is limited to South East Asian 
Nations to minimize computational time but can easily be extended to other
regions since I used an API to query my data. Lastly, it is deployed to
share.streamlit.io to easily share the app for submission to the professor and 
use of anyone with the link.

I used a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jerryendrina/535Project/blob/main/staticVersion.ipynb) 
to create a static version of the app before I translated it to an interactive one.
